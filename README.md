# m3-sun-detection
Proof of Concept to detect the sun's postition in a live camera stream of the current device inside a persistent web app. 
Using OpenCV.js for the detection. The detection is not perfect and generally detects also other bright and small spots, e.g. reflections of the sun in a window.
The [SolarTracker of AmarYasser](https://github.com/AmarYasser/Solar_Tracker_Capstone_CppNd/blob/master/src/SunDetector.cpp) served as a basis.

WIP code
